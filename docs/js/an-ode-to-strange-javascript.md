A head melting game I discovered a few years ago.

Shared by a solid dude I worked with at the time. Plenty of people joke about
the despair of using JavaScript. Erling Ellingsen decided that it would be fun
to gamify it. Because you didn't have enough suffering, right? 😋

Today, things have matured to some degree and we should be grateful for that.
Evolution of all things can be at times, strange.

I mean who doesn't love Flash or SilverLight.
